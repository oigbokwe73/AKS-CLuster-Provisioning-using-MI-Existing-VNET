Here’s the **clean, Linux-native way** to add a **host entry**—with a few **AKS / private-DNS-specific tips** since this often comes up when testing **private AKS API servers** from jump boxes or build agents.

---

## 1️⃣ Add a Host Entry in Linux (Standard Way)

On **most Linux distributions**, host entries live in:

```
/etc/hosts
```

### Step 1 – Open the file (requires sudo)

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

(or `vi` if you prefer)

---

### Step 2 – Add your entry

**Format**

```
<IP_ADDRESS>   <FQDN>   <SHORT_NAME>
```

**Example (AKS private API server)**

```text
10.20.4.5   myaks-123456.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io   myaks
```

✔ IP = Private endpoint IP
✔ FQDN = AKS private API DNS name
✔ Short name = optional

---

### Step 3 – Save and exit

* **nano** → `CTRL + O`, `Enter`, `CTRL + X`
* **vi** → `:wq`

---

## 2️⃣ Verify the Entry Works

```bash
getent hosts myaks-123456.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io
```

or

```bash
ping myaks-123456.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io
```

You should see the private IP returned.

---

## 3️⃣ Clear DNS Cache (If Needed)

Most systems **do not cache `/etc/hosts`**, but if you’re running `systemd-resolved`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

Check status:

```bash
resolvectl status
```

---

## 4️⃣ Important: Ensure `/etc/hosts` Is Actually Used

Linux uses **Name Service Switch (NSS)**.

Check:

```bash
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
```

You should see:

```text
hosts: files dns
```

✔ `files` = `/etc/hosts`
✔ `dns` = DNS resolution

If `files` is missing, `/etc/hosts` entries **won’t work**.

---

## 5️⃣ Temporary (One-Off) Host Override (No File Edit)

Useful for **quick AKS testing**:

```bash
curl --resolve myaks-123456.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io:443:10.20.4.5 https://myaks-123456.privatelink.eastus.azmk8s.io
```

✔ Does not persist
✔ Great for CI/CD debugging

---

## 6️⃣ When This Is Commonly Needed (AKS Context)

You typically add a host entry when:

| Scenario                                    | Why                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Jump box outside AKS VNet                   | No Private DNS link        |
| CI agent (GitHub, Azure DevOps self-hosted) | DNS not forwarding         |
| On-prem testing                             | Private DNS not integrated |
| Emergency access                            | DNS misconfigured          |

⚠️ **Not recommended as a long-term solution**—use **Private DNS + DNS Resolver** instead.

---

## 7️⃣ Best Practice Reminder (Enterprise AKS)

**Do NOT rely on `/etc/hosts`** for:

* Production automation
* Multi-node environments
* Scaling scenarios

Instead:

* Azure Private DNS
* DNS Private Resolver
* Conditional forwarding from on-prem

---

## 8️⃣ Quick AKS-Focused Checklist

```bash
# Get AKS private API FQDN
az aks show -g rg-aks -n aks-prod --query privateFqdn -o tsv

# Get private endpoint IP
nslookup <privateFqdn>

# Add to /etc/hosts if DNS is broken
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
